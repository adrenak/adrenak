### Hi there 👋

<details>
<summary><h3>🗣️🌐🔊 UniVoice updates</h3></summary>  

All previously [separate UniVoice repositories](https://github.com/adrenak?tab=repositories&q=univoice&type=&language=&sort=) have been moved to the [main UniVoice repository](https://github.com/adrenak/univoice) in efforts of making it a mono repo and unifying all out of the box UniVoice features. This means no more dealing with a big list of package dependencies!  
  
Mirror support is available and Opus codec has been added via [Concentus-Unity](https://www.github.com/adrenak/concentus-unity).  
  
The archived repositories only work with UniVoice v3 and not v4. Old network implementations for Telepathy, Airpeer and PUN2 are currently unavailable as they need to be upgraded to v4.  

UniVoice has some big improvements lined up, this includes:
- ✍️ Better documentation and maybe even some video tutorials
- 🗣️ Echo cancellation
- 🛜 Implementations for Network For GameObjects, PUN2 and maybe also com.unity.webrtc

Thanks for the continued support! If you are joining or have been part of the UniVoice journey, give it a Github star ⭐!
